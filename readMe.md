## Gatekeeper - Custom Email Verification in Discord Servers
Gatekeeper is a Discord bot that allows server administrators to seamlessly integrate custom domain email verification.

### Example Use Case:
- University Discord Server: Give a "Verified Student" role to members of the community that verify their school emails using Gatekeeper.
    - Provides the ability for Discord servers to *verify* student affiliation within their communities.

### Things to Know:
- This bot utilizes [MailGun](https://www.mailgun.com/) to send authentication emails, however it can be easily modified to use [SendGrid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sendgrid/mail) as well. 
    - You are free to implement something like [SMTPjs](https://www.smtpjs.com/) if you wish. 
- This bot uses MySQL to store whitelists, authentication codes, and used emails.
