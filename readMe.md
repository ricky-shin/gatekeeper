Gatekeeper is a Discord bot that allows server administrators to seamlessly integrate (custom domain) email verification.

Gatekeeper acts as a middleman for server owners and members of their community. This means server owners do NOT have access* to user supplied emails, preserving user anonymity.

Example Use Case:
- University Discord server that connects students together. Give a "Verified Student" role to members of the community that verify their school emails using Gatekeeper.
